# HW2
this repository contains a jupyter notebook with all the solutions of the second ADM assignment. for almost every plots **"plotly"** package is used.
Unfortunately Github doesn't support plotly visualization,that's why i suggest to see the jupyter notebook on this link: 

   *   **https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/davidetedd9203/HW2/blob/main/HW2.ipynb**.

To facilitate debugging. during the development phase I used only the files relating to the months of October 2019 and November 2019, however the approach used can easily be extended to all the other files without encountering problems regarding memory issues
